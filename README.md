# Advanced Calculator in C# WinForms  

## Overview  
**Advanced Calculator** is a feature-rich, easy-to-use **C# WinForms application** that supports a variety of mathematical operations. Designed for both basic and advanced calculations, it includes support for functions such as trigonometry, logarithms, exponents, and more. This calculator also provides an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface.  

## Features  
- **Basic Operations**: Supports **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**.  
- **Advanced Functions**: Includes **square roots**, **powers**, **logarithms**, **trigonometric functions** (sin, cos, tan), and more.  
- **Memory Functions**: **Memory recall**, **memory store**, and **memory clear**.  
- **Scientific Mode**: Switch to scientific mode to access additional mathematical operations like **exponential**, **log**, and **factorial**.  
- **Decimal & Fraction Support**: Supports decimal and fractional input and conversion.  
- **Clear All**: Clear all inputs or reset the entire calculator.  
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles errors such as division by zero.  
- **User-Friendly UI**: Simple, intuitive interface with a clean layout and responsive buttons.  

## System Requirements  
- **.NET Framework 4.7+**  
- **C# Windows Forms (WinForms)**  
- **Windows OS (7, 8, 10, 11)**  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Graph Plotting**: Add a feature to graph functions based on user input.  
- **Scientific Mode Enhancements**: More advanced functions like **logarithms with different bases**, **complex number calculations**, etc.  
- **Dark Mode UI**: Implement a dark mode theme for the interface.  
- **Unit Conversions**: Add functionality for converting between different units (e.g., length, temperature, etc.).
